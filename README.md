# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
There are many ways in which I can ensure that the code, program, and softare is functional and secure. A first step in doing so is to have the proper mindset if the goal is to write a complex program. A mindset which expects errors and bugs to be made. That way a lenient bias does not prevent me from correcting bugs and/or errors upon review. Another way is to take an incremental approach in writing the code, which can include writing pseudocode beforehand as a preparation. Also by implementing the tools that I learned in this course, namely unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and CI/CD. Other security measures may include running OWASP dependency checks.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by gathering requirements and reading them, whether that be through a rubric document or through a Daily Scrum, it depends on the setting. Then translate the client's requirements into lean, high quality code resulting in a fully functional, bug-free software end product which meets the user's needs and expectations.

# How do I approach designing software?
I approach desigining software incrementally with the user's or client's needs and expectations in mind, and with the proper analytical mindset that I described above. A mindset which expects bugs and errors to be made and then corrected.
